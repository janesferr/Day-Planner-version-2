This is a simple calendar applicaiton that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.  It has a color coded theme for each hour of the day whether it is the current time or in the past hour or future.

This website will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.  It uses a library like Moment.js  which has historically been the most popular date/time library but no longer supported by its developers.  There are alternatives to using this library instead which are:

 * [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/)

  * [Day.js](https://day.js.org/)

  * [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/)

  * [js-Joda](https://js-joda.github.io/js-joda/)

Whichever library you choose, be sure to read the documentation carefully!

This website is for an employee with a busy schedule to add important events to a daily planner so that they can manage their time effectively.
